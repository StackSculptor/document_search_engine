# document_search_engine

Harness the power of my Document Search Engine to effortlessly search and rank documents based on their relevance to your query. Built on a foundation of sophisticated algorithms, this search engine is particularly designed for sifting through vast volumes of text documents.

Features

    TF-IDF Vectorization: Implements Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency to convert raw text into meaningful vectors.
    Cosine Similarity: Efficiently ranks documents based on the cosine of the angle between the document and query vectors.
    Scalability: Easily scalable to handle larger document datasets.
    User-Friendly Interface: Simple command-line interface for easy interaction.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Python 3.x
    scikit-learn
    pandas

Installation

    Clone this repository:

bash

git clone <[repository_url](https://github.com/StackSculptor/document_search_engine/tree/main)>

    Navigate to the Document Search Engine directory:

bash

cd path_to_document_search_engine_directory

    Install the required packages:

pip install scikit-learn pandas

Using the Document Search Engine

    Place your collection of text documents in the specified directory.
    Execute the script:

python app.py

    Enter your search query when prompted.
    The engine will display relevant documents, ranked by their relevance to your query.

Customization

    Document Dataset: You can customize the dataset by adding your collection of documents. Ensure the script is updated to point to the correct directory.
    Vectorization Options: The TfidfVectorizer parameters can be adjusted to tweak the tokenization and vectorization process.

Potential Enhancements

    Integration of more advanced ranking algorithms.
    Expansion to support various file types (e.g., PDF, DOCX).
    Inclusion of a graphical user interface.
